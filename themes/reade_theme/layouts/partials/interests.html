  <h2 class="homepage__section__title">Health</h2>
  <p>I take my physical and mental health very seriously.</p>
  <p>I'm on the Paleo diet, I intermittent fast (I usually eat one meal per day), I take cold showers every night, I lift weights three times a week, I meditate, blah-blah-blah.</p>
  <p>Upholding balance is my biggest priority in life.</p>

  <h2 class="homepage__section__title">Language</h2>
  <p>If I had unlimited money I'd spend all my time studying languages.</p>
  <p>I'm currently learning <span class="tech">Japanese</span> and I absolutely love it. I've also seriously learnt <span class="tech">French</span> and <span class="tech">Chinese</span> in the past (although I've spent most my life learning Chinese, and I absolutely hate it).</p>

  <h2 class="homepage__section__title">Gaming</h2>
  <p>I'm a huge gamer.</p>
  <p>Gee, I think I've been playing video games since I could physically pick up a controller, and I also love complex board games and that kind of thing.</p>
  <p>I'm super excited for VR gaming to become a thing <b>*fingers crossed*</b>.</p>

  <h2 class="homepage__section__title">Business</h2>
  <p>I've always been a business guy at heart.</p>
  <p>I love building strong brands, and you may view an entire graveyard of them in GitHub account.</p>
  <p>One day I will hack the Millenial dream of maintaining a sustainable passive income over something I'm passionate about, and with each failed project I learn something new about what not to do next time.</p>
{{/*  
  <p>The biggest lesson I've learnt is that great ideas don't matter. What matters are great ideas that you're passionate about.</p>
  <p>While I've created a lot of to-be successful businesses in the past, the biggest lesson I've learnt is that having an amazing, sustainable idea isn't enough (at least for me).</p>
  <p>What's important is coming up with something you're actively passionate about, is easy to execute AND can make you a lot of money, which is something I'm still trying to figure out.</p>
  <p>In part, because I'd be bootstrapping the whole thing.</p>
  <p>Regardless, each time you learn something different which helps you get further each time and develop stronger as an entrepreneur.</p>  */}}
