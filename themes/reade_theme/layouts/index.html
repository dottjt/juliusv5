        <h2 class="homepage__section__title">About me</h2>
        <p>I've been a self-taught programmer since 2015.</p>
        <p>I come from a strong background of sales, marketing, copywriting and </p>
        <p>I prefer pure, composable functions. (Javascript desperately needs a pipe operator)</p>
        <p>I believe learning new API's and languages is quicker than trying to retrofit existing solutions.</p>

          <h3>Client Frameworks</h3>
          <p>For large commercial applications I recommend using <span>React</span> as a front-end, along with TypeScript.</p>

          <p><span>TypeScript</span> is a must with React. I can't think of a single good reason not to use it, even with existing projects.</p>
          <p>For small teams I recommend using <span>Elm</span>. It allows you to build the same thing in half the time. You get type safety + state management baked in for free and your app will run much faster.</p>
          <p>I'd even recommend Elm for large commercial projects, but you'd never convince management or even senior staff entrenched in their old ways.</p>

          <h3>State management</h3>
          <p>I much prefer using <span>Apollo</span> over <span>Redux</span>.</p>
          <p>Redux boilerplate is a huge productivity killer, and Apollo provides the same clean uni-directional data flow at a fraction of the code.</p>

          <h3>Server Frameworks</h3>
          <p>Node.js and Elixir satisfy everything you could possibly need for a backend.</p>
          <p>Meteor.js is great for building quick MVP projects, especially if you need real-time functionality.</p>
          <p>Phoenix Framework is also amazing for achieving the same thing. Difference being that your project will actually scale and you won't have to rebuild it again within a few years (at the cost of taking a little bit more time to develop).</p>
          <p>Express.js is average at best. Feathers.js is a good alternative (it's built upon Express.js) that provides real-time functionality + some great services. Nest.js is great for building scalable APIs.</p>

          <p>There is also the incredible Parse Server self-hosted BAAS (built on node.js) which is what I primarily use to build my backends. It comes baked with so much functionality, it really is a huge time saver.</p>


          <h3>GraphQL</h3>
          <p>In terms of GraphQL servers, Prisma is amazing BAAS if you have the money. graphql-yoga is generally my go-to.</p>

          <h3>Web Infrastructure</h3>
          <p>To be quite frank, AWS is almost always overkill.</p>
          <p>In most cases, you can avoid having to use AWS if you use the right tech to begin with (Elixir for concurrent connections etc.)</p>
          <p>In most cases, a simple VPS via Dropbox is going to be more than enough, and you'll save a bucketload of money.</p>
